# Human Activity Recognition Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an R script to analyze the Human Activity Recognition dataset using smartphones. The analysis merges training and test datasets, processes the data, and generates a tidy dataset.

## Repository Structure
- `run_analysis.R`: The R script that performs the data analysis.
- `tidy_data.txt`: The tidy dataset generated from the analysis.
- `CodeBook.md`: A description of the variables and transformations performed on the data.
- `README.md`: An overview of the repository and instructions.

## How to Run the Analysis
1. **Set Up**: Ensure R and required libraries (`dplyr`) are installed.
2. **Download the Dataset**: Place the Human Activity Recognition dataset files in the same directory as the script.
3. **Run the Script**: Open R or RStudio, set your working directory, and run the script:
   ```R
   source("run_analysis.R")
